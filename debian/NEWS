junit4 (4.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

   Revert change done in 4.6-1 : don't install a symlink in ANT_HOME/lib directory
    - This can cause unexpected behavior for people using both JUnit 3.x and JUnit 4.x
    - This is not recommended by upstream

   For usage of JUnit4 with ant, you should have a look at README.Debian.
